<h1 align= "center" >AI Engineer Headquarters</h1>
<p>
A drill of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to build stories & models. An in-depth learning resource for humans.

This is a drill for people who aim to be in the top 1% of Data and AI experts.

You can do the drill by watching video sessions or text content.

I will recommend video sessions and use text content as go-to notes.

You can be in one of the following categories:-
- either you are working on a leadership position
- or you are working as a professional
- or you are a student

No matter what position you are working in currently, you need to put in the same amount of effort to be in the top 1%.

Spoiler alert - There are NO Shortcuts in the tech field.

This is for all humans who want to improve in the field and are courageous enough to take action.

You will find all the topics explained here and whatever is needed to understand it completely.

The drill is all action-oriented.

To be the authority/best in the AI field, I created a routine that includes:
- 4 hours of deep work sessions every day
    - Deep work session rules:
        - no phone/notifications
        - no talking to anyone
        - coffee/chai allowed
- 2 hours of shallow work sessions every day
    - Shallow work session rules:
        - phone allowed
        - talking allowed
        - include sharing your work online

You can customize the learning sessions according to your time availability.
